It has being resurged and improved since 2014, and became a great point of attraction for Moscowians and city guests.

      Seven sisters 
  </div>
  <p>
    There are seven "Stalin towers" built in 1950s. They all look alike for a stranger, although for me they all are very different. One (the most beautiful one, of course), for example, is the main building of my university. Another one is the building of Ministry of forreign affairs. Some of them are hotels or living buildings. By the way, they have an eighth sister in Warsaw, which is also quite beautiful, although not so majestic.

    There are many more things to name and show and their description would never fit into 3 paragraphs. I made a skyline to show just a few of them. But you're very welcome to come and see them yourself :)
