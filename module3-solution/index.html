            VDNKH (short for what can be translted as "Peoples achievments exibition") is a huge park with different pavillions, and different museums, as well as wonderful fountains and monuments. It has being resurged and improved since 2014, and became a great point of attraction for Moscowians and city guests.

          There are seven "Stalin towers" built in 1950s. They all look alike for a stranger, although for me they all are very different. One (the most beautiful one, of course), for example, is the main building of university I study. Another one is the building of Ministry of forreign affairs. Some are hotels or living buildings. There were eight such buildings on the plan, but eighth was naver built. Nevertheless, they have an "eighth sister" in Warsaw, which is also quite beautiful, although not so majestic.

          There are many more things to name and show and their description would never fit into 3 paragraphs. I made a skyline to show just a few of them. But you're very welcome to come and see them yourself :)
